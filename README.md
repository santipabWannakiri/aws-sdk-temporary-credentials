# aws-sdk-temporary-credentials
## Introduction
When I get started with AWS, the majority of the tutorials that I find are going to focus on creating and managing AWS services via the console. However, actually, AWS Service provides another two ways: the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) that you can access to manage AWS Service. I tried to conduct it that way, but it's not as easy as the console. There are many prerequisites that you need to meet in advance. From my experience, I spent a whole day getting to understand the concept and being able to build a SDK to connect to an AWS service. So on this POC project, I would like to note everything based on my understanding, and I hope it will help other people who are new to AWS and might not waste their time like me.
